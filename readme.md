# Overview
This repository constitutes my master graduation project. The reposotory includes Keras implementation of 
"Thoracic Disease Identification and Localization with Limited Supervision" https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06373 
for a single class (in cnn module) 
and further experiments on evaluating stability of MIL algorithms (in stability module)..
